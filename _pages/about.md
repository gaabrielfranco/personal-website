Hi! I am Gabriel, 4th year Computer Science PhD student at Boston University working with [Mark Crovella](https://www.cs.bu.edu/fac/crovella/). I have a BSc and an MSc in Computer Science from Universidade Federal de Vi√ßosa, Brazil, where I worked with [Giovanni Comarela](http://www.inf.ufes.br/~gc/).

My main research interest is mechanistic interpretability of large language models (LLMs). Before that, I used to work in a weakly supervised learning problem called Learning from Label Proportions (LLP).

Before joining BU, I worked as a Data Scientist for Localiza and SEEK AIPS in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. During my time in the industry, I mostly worked on developing and deploying machine learning models and recommender systems, using technologies such as Golang, Python/ML libraries, ElasticSearch, and Redis. Also, I was responsible for optimizing some of our models to maintain their efficiency.
