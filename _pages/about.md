Hi! I am Gabriel, 3rd year Computer Science PhD student at Boston University under the guidance of Professor [Mark Crovella](https://www.cs.bu.edu/fac/crovella/). I earned a BSc and an MSc in Computer Science from Universidade Federal de Vi√ßosa, Brazil, where Professor [Giovanni Comarela](http://www.inf.ufes.br/~gc/) advised me. 

My main research interest is machine learning, specifically in a weakly supervised learning problem called Learning from Label Proportions. Moreover, I am interested in auditing AI systems/LLMs, fairness, and recommender systems.

Before joining BU, I worked as a Data Scientist for Localiza and SEEK AIPS in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. During my time in the industry, I mostly worked on developing and deploying machine learning models and recommender systems, using technologies such as Golang, Python/ML libraries, ElasticSearch, and Redis. Also, I was responsible for optimizing some of our models to maintain their efficiency.
